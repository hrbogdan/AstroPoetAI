    <!-- Our idea -->
    <div class="how-we-started">
      <p>
        We developed an app, placing a strong emphasis on user experience and
        design, intending to create an intuitive and user-friendly interface
        that encourages users to explore and experiment with different styles
        and themes. We included features that allow users to personalize their
        experience with the app, such as the ability to input their own words or
        phrases or customize the style and structure of the generated poems.
        After several hours of development and testing, we launched our AI poem
        generator and we're proud of our creation.

            Team initiative refers to the proactive and collaborative effort of
            a group of individuals who work together towards a common goal or
            objective. It involves taking ownership of a project or task and
            working towards its successful completion as a team, while
            leveraging the diverse skills, strengths, and perspectives of each
            team member. A team initiative requires effective communication,
            coordination, and cooperation among team members to achieve shared
            goals and objectives. It often involves problem-solving,
            decision-making, and a willingness to take risks and learn from
            mistakes as a team.
